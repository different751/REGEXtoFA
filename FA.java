 *Assignment: Project 1 regular expressions to nfa
 *
 *Program description:
 *This program is designed to take in a regular expression in post fix notation from a file
 *and then convert that regular expression into a NFA. The output will consist of states
 *that transition with the given symbol of input. The program uses a stack to hold
 *the constructed NFAs and a list to hold the transitions of each NFA. This program 
 *was assigned to gain a better understanding of regular expressions and how to 
 *design NFAs from regular expressions.
